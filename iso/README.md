# live

This directory contains the configs for the live and install images.

* live: this is the normal live ISO (live${VERSION}). It contains the
full Ragnarok base system, including the devel and xserv sets/metapackages
(but omits the virt set).

* install (**not yet ready**): small ISO that boots straight to the installer.
