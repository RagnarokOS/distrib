# Dummies

These are dummy packages containing nothing. Due to [This issue](https://github.com/RagnarokOS/iso/issues/1),
packages from the ragnarok repository can't be installed via the
repo on this iso. They are compiled from source at iso build time
instead, but apt needs to be aware of these packages being installed
so they can be updated once booted in the live environment.
