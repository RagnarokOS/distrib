distrib
=======

Ragnarok's release building infrastructure.

**NOTE**: the whole infrastructure is being redone due to Ragnarok's
switch to a Gentoo base. To build Debian-based ISOs/releases, switch
to the 'debian' branch, or clone it with `git clone -b debian ...`.

Building
========

*Under development. These build instructions may change and stop working
at any moment. In which case simply wait for them to be updated.*

Soon...
